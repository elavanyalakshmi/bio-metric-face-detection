A biometric face detection attendance system uses a 
camera to recognize people's faces. It identifies individuals 
by comparing their facial features with stored data. 
Apply a face detection algorithm to identify and locate faces 
in images. Use a face recognition algorithm to match 
detected faces with stored biometric data.
Capture an image using the camera.Extract unique biometric 
features of the detected face. Match the extracted features 
with those in the database.Use Python programming language with libraries like 
OpenCV, dlib, and face recognition. Utilize SQLite or any 
suitable database for storing biometric data.
